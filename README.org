* YASM - Yet Another Stupid Automounter
** Description

   YASM automatically mounts devices that are specified in its config file. The
   assumption is that you don't want to mount all devices automatically like
   most other automounters do, but only a selected few.

** Dependencies

   - ghc
   - cabal

** Installation

   If you have ghc and cabal installed, you can type

   : cabal install --only-dependencies
   : cabal configure
   : cabal build
   : cabal install --bindir=${HOME}/bin/

   See ~cabal configure --help~ for options.

** Usage

   There are no command-line options. Just call it on system startup.

   : yasm

** Config File

   The config file lists devices to mount. Each line consists of a property and
   arbitrary arguments. Properties are:

   - uuid :: Match device by UUID
   - device :: Match device by device-file

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   uuid bfc53be6-ce03-42e8-909a-047c058490c3
   device /dev/sda1
   #+END_EXAMPLE
